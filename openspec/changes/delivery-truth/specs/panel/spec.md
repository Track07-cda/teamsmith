## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The deferred-delivery queue is read, counted and never touched

The console SHALL read `state/outbox/` read-only and expose the queued entry count, the count under `held/`, the
age of the oldest queued entry and the number of forced deliveries, so that "N messages are waiting because the
PM's box was busy" is visible where the PM looks. A missing `outbox/` directory SHALL be rendered as zero, never
as an error, and the console MUST NOT create it. The console MUST NOT enqueue, claim, move or drain an entry
itself: the drain belongs to the sender, the tick and `team outbox flush` (`delivery-guard`). The console's flush
action (`f`) SHALL invoke `team outbox flush` as a subprocess and report its outcome; the renderer MUST NOT edit
the queue's files. The messages page SHALL list the queued and held entries individually and SHALL show one
entry's full text read-only and sanitized; discarding an entry is not a console action in v1.

The read-only panel SHALL additionally expose impeded delivery count and reasons (`geometry-untrusted`, `queue-stalled`) from the delivery diagnostics in the status band and messages page, and as additive fields `panel.outbox.impeded` and `panel.outbox.impediments` in JSON. An impediment item SHALL name its entry id, target, reason and last observation time. The plain-text path SHALL expose the same impediment facts; a TUI-only field is not sufficient. Reasons MUST NOT be replaced by a draft-clearing promise. An unreadable diagnostic SHALL render as unknown/unavailable, never silently infer zero impediments. These observers MUST NOT capture a pane, advance drain observations, create a diagnostic or retry delivery; the existing flush subprocess owns all changes.

#### Scenario: An impediment is visible in every observer mode without mutation

- **GIVEN** a held `queue-stalled` entry and a held `geometry-untrusted` entry with recorded payload/diagnostic hashes
- **WHEN** `team monitor --json`, `team monitor --print` and a TUI messages frame render
- **THEN** JSON reports `panel.outbox.impeded=2` and both entry ids/reasons in `panel.outbox.impediments`; text and TUI name the same impediment count/reasons; all hashes and drain observation counts are unchanged, and the outbox block itself performs no pane capture or key operation

#### Scenario: A missing queue is a zero

- **GIVEN** a fixture project with no `state/outbox/` directory
- **WHEN** `team monitor --json` and `team monitor --print` run
- **THEN** `panel.outbox.queued` is 0, the printed status band shows the zero, and `state/outbox/` still does not
  exist

#### Scenario: Queued, held and the oldest age come from the entry names

- **GIVEN** three entries named `<epoch-ms>-<seq>-pm.msg` under `state/outbox/` and one under `state/outbox/held/`
- **WHEN** `team monitor --json` runs
- **THEN** `panel.outbox.queued` is 3, `panel.outbox.held` is 1 and `panel.outbox.oldest_age_s` is the current
  time minus the oldest name's epoch in milliseconds, within two seconds

#### Scenario: Three render modes leave the queue byte-identical

- **GIVEN** a fixture project with two queued entries and their file hashes recorded
- **WHEN** `team monitor --print`, `team monitor --json` and one `team monitor --once` frame have run
- **THEN** both entries still hash the same, no file was added under `state/outbox/`, and `forced.log` and
  `HOLDING.log` did not grow

#### Scenario: Flush goes through the guard, never through the renderer

- **GIVEN** a fixture project with one queued entry and a fixture PM pane whose input box holds a draft
- **WHEN** `f` is pressed in the console
- **THEN** `team outbox flush` runs as a subprocess, the receipt reports the entry as still queued (the box was
  busy), and the entry file's hash is unchanged

#### Scenario: Entries are listed and shown read-only

- **GIVEN** two queued entries and one held entry with recorded hashes
- **WHEN** the messages page renders and one entry is viewed in full
- **THEN** both queued entries are listed with their ages, the viewed text is the file's sanitized content, and
  every file under `state/outbox/` hashes the same afterwards

### Requirement: A human can write to the PM from any page

`m` on any page SHALL open a bottom input line. Enter SHALL send the draft through the guarded delivery path
(`team draft send`; the `delivery-guard` capability owns the semantics) — the console itself MUST NOT paste or
send keys into the PM's pane. Esc SHALL cancel the compose and keep the draft in `state/draft.md`, restored on
the next compose. `C-o` SHALL hand the draft to `$EDITOR` and return to an intact frame, with rendering
suspended while the editor runs; `C-e` is the line-end key, not the editor relay (the migration to pi's key map,
which the key-map requirement owns), and the compose hint SHALL name both the editor relay's key and the newline
key in the frame, in both languages. The receipt SHALL be exactly one of three honest states — delivered, queued
(a trusted read observed a draft) or held (a durable copy under `outbox/held/`) — mapped from the send command's
machine-readable outcome and exit code, never parsed from human prose. A `geometry-untrusted` or `queue-stalled` held outcome MUST retain that reason in the receipt rather than say that the PM has a draft or promise automatic delivery after clearing it. While composing, the input line SHALL
pause refreshing and every other block SHALL keep refreshing; multi-line input, pasted or typed, SHALL stay one
draft (a `\r` is normalized — E6 §2.2) and SHALL be sent as one message (E6 §2.1).

#### Scenario: Geometry and stalled outcomes retain their machine reason

- **GIVEN** a compose send or flush subprocess returning a machine-readable held outcome with reason `geometry-untrusted` or `queue-stalled` and non-zero exit
- **WHEN** the panel displays its receipt
- **THEN** the receipt says held with that reason and durable entry id, not delivered or a draft-clearing promise; removing the reason mapping in a test process makes the receipt test fail

#### Scenario: A busy box yields an honest queued receipt

- **GIVEN** a fixture PM pane whose input box holds a draft, and the console running in another fixture pane
- **WHEN** the human composes `hello` and presses Enter
- **THEN** the receipt shows queued, exactly one entry lands in `state/outbox/`, and the PM pane's draft is
  byte-identical

#### Scenario: Esc preserves the draft across a restart

- **GIVEN** the console running in a fixture pane
- **WHEN** the human types `half a thought`, presses Esc, quits, relaunches and presses `m`
- **THEN** the input line holds `half a thought` and `state/draft.md` survived the restart

#### Scenario: The editor relay returns to an intact frame

- **GIVEN** a compose holding `raw1`
- **WHEN** `C-o` opens `$EDITOR`, a second line is appended, the editor is saved and closed, and Enter is pressed
- **THEN** the frame is intact after the handoff, the draft holds both lines, and the send enqueues exactly one
  entry holding both lines

#### Scenario: A paste is one message

- **GIVEN** a compose open in a fixture pane
- **WHEN** a three-line payload is pasted and Enter is pressed
- **THEN** the draft held all three lines and exactly one outbox entry was written

#### Scenario: The draft survives a refresh

- **GIVEN** the five-second reader stub and a compose holding `before`
- **WHEN** a refresh completes and the human then types `after`
- **THEN** the draft reads `beforeafter` and another block's timestamp advanced during the compose

#### Scenario: `C-e` moves to the line end while `C-o` is the editor relay

- **GIVEN** a fixture project whose `state/draft.md` holds `ad`, `TEAM_PANEL_EDITOR` naming a script that writes a
  marker file and appends a line to the draft file, and the console composing with the insertion point between the
  two characters
- **WHEN** `C-e` is pressed
- **THEN** the script never ran (its marker file does not exist), the draft still reads `ad` and
  `tmux display -p '#{cursor_x}'` is 6 — the key moved to the line's end
- **AND** a following `C-o` runs the script exactly once, the appended line appears in the draft, and the frame is
  intact afterwards
