## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The new-project questionnaire checks Pi's version and its plugins, and asks nothing about adapters

The `teamsmith-init` skill's checklist SHALL keep its detection surface to the two facts the project actually
promises: the Pi version floor (`README.md`'s requirement — Pi ≥ 0.76.0, the `--session-id` floor
`team doctor` fails on) and the plugins `team doctor` reports (`已装插件 packages`). It MUST NOT ask which
harness the user's sessions run, MUST NOT name or branch on another harness (`omp`, "another CLI"), and MUST
NOT mention the four adapter keys (`TEAM_AGENT_CMD`, `TEAM_AGENT_NOTIFY_CMD`, `TEAM_AGENT_LOG_GLOB`,
`TEAM_AGENT_BIN`) or send the reader to `references/agent-adapters.md`. The doctor rows behind the two facts
SHALL keep their behaviour: the `pi` row judges the floor by `--session-id` (a probe whose `--help` goes to
stderr, as Pi 0.76.0–0.79.0 did, still passes), and the plugin row only reports what is installed — it never
asks the user to install a third-party plugin and recommends only what teamsmith requires or ships itself.
Only questionnaire text changes: no rendered template, config key, default or command output moves, and no
existing project needs an edit.

#### Scenario: The checklist is Pi-only

- **WHEN** `skills/teamsmith-init/SKILL.md` is searched for a harness question and for the seam
  (`which harness`, `\bomp\b`, `another CLI`, `TEAM_AGENT_CMD`, `TEAM_AGENT_BIN`, `TEAM_AGENT_NOTIFY_CMD`,
  `TEAM_AGENT_LOG_GLOB`, `agent-adapters.md`)
- **THEN** the search prints nothing, while the same file names `team doctor`, the Pi floor (Pi ≥ 0.76.0) and
  the `已装插件 packages` row it prescribes
- **AND** the fixture's red side — a scratch copy with `omp` or `TEAM_AGENT_CMD` appended to the checklist —
  makes the same search print that line and exit non-zero

#### Scenario: The two doctor rows still answer the check

- **GIVEN** a stub `TEAM_PI_BIN` whose `--help` carries `--session-id` on stdout, a second stub whose
  `--help` writes to stderr (the 0.76.0–0.79.0 shape), a third stub without `--session-id`, and settings
  files naming two installed packages
- **WHEN** `team doctor` runs against each stub and against a settings file without packages
- **THEN** the first two runs pass the `pi` row, the third fails naming the missing flag, and the plugin row
  lists the installed packages (or says none were detected) without naming any third-party package to install
- **AND** the existing gate sections §15b (Pi-version probes) and §15c (harness and plugin list: inform only,
  never recommend) stay green without a test edit

#### Scenario: No rendered contract and no existing project moves

- **GIVEN** a fixture project
- **WHEN** `team bootstrap --print` runs and a rendered `.pi/team/config.sh` is compared with the previous
  revision's rendering
- **THEN** the plan still lists its five stages, the four `TEAM_AGENT_*` keys are still rendered empty, no new
  key appears, and the `config-cli.sh` completeness walk (schema ↔ template ↔ `references/config.md`) stays
  green without a test edit
